# This is for whitelisting rather than blacklisting of files. First every file
# is ignored/blacklisted and then the the files that are needed are whitelisted
# individually to be included in the final NPM package
# Reason - To create a lean package

# Blacklisted files

# Whitelisted files
!/nodes/**/*
!/package.json
!/README.md
